## Getting Started

This section will help you set up and use the Embedder project on your local machine.

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the repository locally using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/news-on-blockchain/embedder.git
   cd embedder
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**  
   Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store any necessary environment variables. For example:
   ```env
   MODEL_PATH=/path/to/embedding/model
   DATASET_PATH=/path/to/dataset
   ```

2. **Custom Settings**  
   Update configuration files (if applicable) to customize the behavior of the project.

---

## Usage

1. **Run the Embedder**  
   Use the main script to execute the embedding process:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Example Commands**  
   Add an example of how users can utilize the main functionality:
   ```bash
   python main.py --input data/sample.txt --output embeddings/output.json
   ```

3. **Output**  
   Describe what the user can expect as output, e.g., "The embeddings will be saved in the specified directory."
